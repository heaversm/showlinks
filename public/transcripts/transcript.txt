[00:00:00 --> 00:00:03]
All right, we're back.
[00:00:03 --> 00:00:07]
I have a big question and I'm going to just hammer you about podcast wars.
[00:00:07 --> 00:00:08]
Both of you, please.
[00:00:08 --> 00:00:09]
Here's the fight.
[00:00:09 --> 00:00:12]
If you look at TV, there's free over the air broadcast TV.
[00:00:12 --> 00:00:14]
It's monetized by commercials.
[00:00:14 --> 00:00:15]
There's cable.
[00:00:15 --> 00:00:18]
Now there's all the premium streaming services.
[00:00:18 --> 00:00:24]
That market fragmented into multiple different options, multiple different business models,
[00:00:24 --> 00:00:25]
multiple different price points.
[00:00:25 --> 00:00:30]
Why hasn't that happened with podcasts, which are a much older sort of form of internet
[00:00:30 --> 00:00:31]
media distribution?
[00:00:31 --> 00:00:34]
Why has it looked the same for so long?
[00:00:34 --> 00:00:38]
My interpretation has always been a sort of just a lack of, this might be a bit dumb to
[00:00:38 --> 00:00:43]
say, but it's like a little bit lack of creativity or innovative ambition and a part of the business
[00:00:43 --> 00:00:45]
class in the podcast industry.
[00:00:45 --> 00:00:50]
It feels like the trend of the podcast executive is to like really double down on trends that
[00:00:50 --> 00:00:53]
everybody else has seen, which is why we keep seeing true crime podcasts, which is like
[00:00:53 --> 00:00:58]
why we keep seeing this sort of double down on the Hollywood adaptation IP pipeline.
[00:00:58 --> 00:01:06]
There is a lack of true business model innovation from the investor money class of this.
[00:01:06 --> 00:01:11]
And I think if we're going to ever see real sort of price point innovation or real business
[00:01:11 --> 00:01:16]
model innovation, it's going to come from the layer that requires some investment money.
[00:01:16 --> 00:01:19]
We see a lot of organic innovation as far as independent podcasters go.
[00:01:19 --> 00:01:23]
There's a lot of really interesting innovation around patron support networks.
[00:01:23 --> 00:01:27]
There's a lot of really interesting innovation around live events and sort of like book publishing
[00:01:27 --> 00:01:28]
and that kind of stuff.
[00:01:28 --> 00:01:34]
But on a fundamental, how do you connect the class of casual podcast listeners and potential
[00:01:34 --> 00:01:38]
podcast listeners to podcasting as a whole?
[00:01:38 --> 00:01:40]
There isn't a ton of that from the ground up.
[00:01:40 --> 00:01:44]
We're going to see that, I think, from the increasing participation of established platforms
[00:01:44 --> 00:01:45]
like Spotify and Pandora.
[00:01:45 --> 00:01:47]
It feels like that is the only way forward.
[00:01:47 --> 00:01:50]
And that's the only way that we're going to see this play out, which is not necessarily
[00:01:50 --> 00:01:52]
good for the ecosystem as a whole.
[00:01:52 --> 00:02:00]
But I understand why there is a lack of it from anywhere else, because I guess nobody
[00:02:00 --> 00:02:04]
really wants to take that risk or nobody really wants to plant a flag or die on the hill on
[00:02:04 --> 00:02:05]
a podcast.
[00:02:05 --> 00:02:07]
It's just not a sexy place to die right now.
[00:02:07 --> 00:02:08]
I mean, it's right.
[00:02:08 --> 00:02:09]
Actually, look at us.
[00:02:09 --> 00:02:12]
I mean, we're like 25 minutes into technical podcasting.
[00:02:12 --> 00:02:15]
I guess it's like the NBA in the 50s.
[00:02:15 --> 00:02:16]
Nobody gives a shit.
[00:02:16 --> 00:02:19]
They only want to watch baseball.
[00:02:19 --> 00:02:23]
That's a great answer because it leads, I think, right into where I think the war is
[00:02:23 --> 00:02:29]
coming from, which is my version of the why isn't it like TV answer is all of those TV
[00:02:29 --> 00:02:31]
companies have their own distribution.
[00:02:31 --> 00:02:32]
Right.
[00:02:32 --> 00:02:37]
So like literally brought like NBC owns antennas in the world and they control a massive distribution
[00:02:37 --> 00:02:38]
point.
[00:02:38 --> 00:02:40]
Cable companies, they sell to other cable companies.
[00:02:40 --> 00:02:42]
It's a massive distribution point.
[00:02:42 --> 00:02:43]
Netflix is like, here's an app.
[00:02:43 --> 00:02:44]
You actually want this stuff.
[00:02:44 --> 00:02:45]
We're putting it in our app.
[00:02:45 --> 00:02:49]
We own this distribution.
[00:02:49 --> 00:02:52]
Podcasts for the longest time have had one distribution point that mattered, which is
[00:02:52 --> 00:02:59]
Apple Podcasts, which is I would describe it as a lumbering sort of organization that
[00:02:59 --> 00:03:02]
hasn't really pushed innovation and distribution and stuff.
[00:03:02 --> 00:03:07]
And so all the other business model innovations require new distribution.
[00:03:07 --> 00:03:09]
And I think it's only now that you see Spotify getting into the game.
[00:03:09 --> 00:03:10]
You see Pandora getting in the game.
[00:03:10 --> 00:03:12]
You see Luminary getting in the game.
[00:03:12 --> 00:03:15]
The idea that this market will fragment has like appeared.
[00:03:15 --> 00:03:18]
I mean, that's my is that your read on it?
[00:03:18 --> 00:03:19]
Yeah.
[00:03:19 --> 00:03:23]
I mean, I think because Apple had the majority of where all the listeners were coming from
[00:03:23 --> 00:03:25]
and they were the winner and that was that.
[00:03:25 --> 00:03:28]
And it was like, OK, we know like Apple's going to do what Apple's going to do.
[00:03:28 --> 00:03:29]
They don't care.
[00:03:29 --> 00:03:30]
Like, OK.
[00:03:30 --> 00:03:35]
But now with Spotify, I think having such a large portion and the ability to bring podcasts
[00:03:35 --> 00:03:36]
to so many more people.
[00:03:36 --> 00:03:37]
Yeah.
[00:03:37 --> 00:03:42]
I think that's why we're going to start seeing more more wars.
