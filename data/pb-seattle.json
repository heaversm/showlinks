There are no sidewalks on our segment of Beacon Ave S, which children walk along daily to catch the school bus. Aside from the elicit reckless driving, there is a general speeding problem from drivers bypassing 51st Ave S by using our neighborhood street as an arterial. The steep grades on either side of S Bond Street aggravate poor speed regulation even by local access drivers, and traffic calming measures are sorely needed.    Doppler radar data collected over an eight day period on Beacon Ave S 100 feet north of S Bond Street showed an 85th percentile of 34MPH and a 99th percentile of 43MPH. This means that fully 15% of the drivers on our road during this period broke the speed limit by at least 9MPH and 1% by at least 18MPH. The maximum speed recorded was 47MPH!

Northlake Way... and people have already been hit.    PROBLEM: Pedestrian crossings leading to these playgrounds (difficulty crossing N. Northlake Way,difficulty crossing N. 34th St). People think that either N. 34th, or N. Northlake Way, are highways - instead of residential streets that people HAVE to cross - they go 50mph OFTEN. I live near there, and even though they repainted the crosswalks (THANK YOU), I see cars zoom AROUND kids &amp; dog-walkers who are in the crosswalk.     On. N. Northlake Way at sunset (when most people arrive &amp; leave Gasworks), the sun blinds the drivers (heading north). And at night, there's no streetlighting near the 2 crosswalks.     Also one crosswalk on N. Northlake Way (near Meridian, at south end of Gasworks Park ) is on a BLIND CURVE with no sign indicating upcoming crosswalk after curve or to slow down (heading north).     There also needs to be a crosswalk on N. Northlake Way at the north end of Gasworks Park (by Wooden Boat School) - people exit the park there, and jaywalk there.

Northlake Way near Gasworks.    3) At Gasworks, REMOVE crossing at blind corner (near Meridian) &amp; remove the crossing midway down (near Densmore) - people don't naturally enter the park at those two points! Move both crosswalks further north.   Move the &quot;blind corner&quot; to be at parking lot entrance instead (nearer to Burke St), where people expect it - and where cars have to slow down anyway. Put the north crossing at the Wooden Boats Ctr (near Woodlawn Ave N.), where people come out of the park (less setting sun in the eyes?)    4) Could you make both crosswalks (on N.

A LOT of visitors legitimately use Gasworks Park at night, for exercise, astronomical events, holiday shows, and just to admire the cityscape lights!    5) Please also consider a few flashing-light crosswalks on N. 34th St. Two good places on N. 34th would be: by the Essential Bakery (next to garbage plant playground), and on N. 34th leading to Gasworks (A crosswalk at Burke &amp; N. 34th would be a good idea, since Meridian &amp; N.34th is also a blind corner, in addition to blinding setting sun.)

    "need": "NE 55th St. is a difficult and dangerous street to cross. There are no marked crosswalks for a 9 block stretch (between 34th Ave NE and 25th Ave NE), despite an active retail area between 28th and 30th Ave. NE. This is a wide road with cars parked only intermittently, leading to fast traffic. Drivers rarely stop for people to cross the street. It has been the spot of at least one collision leading to serious injuries for a woman crossing the street (http://www.ravennabryant.org/2013/11/hit-and-run-on-ne-55th/). Hills and land use (such as Calvary Cemetery) make it even more challenging for people to access a safe crossing.     Crossing anywhere this stretch of NE 55th St. is a challenge, but this proposal focuses on improving the crossing at 30th Ave. NE. This is an important intersection because it is halfway between lights (at 25th and 35th Ave. NE). It is located in a retail core. Some think of it as the &quot;Queen Mary Crossing,&quot; and I can say that just this week when my aging mother in law took my 5 and 7 year old daughters to a tea party I was terrified thinking of them crossing here to get to the gift shop and again to the bus stop. This is on the edge of the cemetery, and is a prime corridor for people walking and biking to Bryant or beyond from U Village and the Burke Gilman trail. Parked cars make it challenging for people driving to see those waiting to cross, especially at the Z-shaped intersection of 30th Ave. NE, where people are attempting to cross from a sidewalk ramp hidden in between cars, rather than at a street corner. There are multiple preschools and child-centered businesses on or adjacent to NE 55th, and so parents commonly need to park on 55th and cross this busy street with young children. (Memorably, when my kids wanted to participate in Bike to School day at their school, we stood on the corner watching cars zoom by for minutes, and were finally only able to walk our bikes across the street when a stranger flagged down traffic and acted as an ad hoc crossing guard.) ",
    "idea": "1) Curb Bulbs  There is already a curb ramp in front of Jack and Jerome at the intersection of NE 55th St. and 30th Ave NE, but anyone waiting to cross there is hidden by parked cars. I would like to see the two adjacent parking spots removed and the creation of a curb bulb. If this were implemented with a lower cost paint/barrier curb bulb, a design like teacups might be painted on to incorporate local character at the &quot;Queen Mary Crossing.&quot;     2) Marked Crosswalks  Because many, especially those biking, cross on the east side of the intersection, two painted crosswalks at both the east and west side where 55th and 30th intersect are key to making this crossing successful.     3) Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon  A RRFB that could be triggered from the sidewalk or by a person on a bike (heading north on 30th) could add another element of visibility.

After living on this corner for four years, I've witnessed multiple vehicle accidents due to the poor markings of this intersection, as well as several near-accidents involving pedestrians attempting to cross.

I spoke to Seattle Public Schools and they have said no to the water fountain on their property due to maintenance concerns.      Hi Irvin,    Yes, I got an estimate last week from Pam Alspaugh (see below).   To install a new drinking fountain on Parks property, the cost would be $54,000 (see the line on the aerial photo attached).  To install one on School District-owned property (see the circle on the attached aerial photo), it would cost about $5-10,000.  For the School District option, you would need to work with the School District because it is on their property.      From Pam Alspaugh, Seattle Parks and Recreation Senior Landscape Architect:    &quot;The best option for a drinking fountain at the tennis courts at Rainier Beach is where there previously was a drinking fountain adjacent to courts on the school property.  The location is circled on the attached photo.  This drinking fountain may have been removed when the school was remodeled.  It would be much less expensive to reinstall a drinking fountain in this location, because there is a water line and a sewer line.  This cost would be estimated at $5,000-$10,000, depending on whether the catch basis remains or if it was removed.    On Park property it looks like the nearest potable water line is about 250' away (solid line on the photo) and the nearest sanitary sewer (dashed line) is about 50' away from the NW corner of the tennis courts.  For a contractor to bid and construct the water and sewer lines, add the required catch basin, purchase and install the drinking fountain, and add associated paving I would estimate the cost would be a minimum of $34,000.  (Total project costs $54,000 with design, etc.)  It could be higher due to site conditions.  This assumes that the NW entry location is ADA accessible.&quot;    Please let me know if you have any questions.    Thanks, Kathleen    ",

The problems are:  Cars come of MLK onto 35th at high speed (it is a 45 degree 'turn') and California roll through the 35th and Dawson intersection and then proceed at high speed down 35th. The road is wider than most other roads in Columbia City and doesn't have a sidewalk on the eastside so it feels 'safer' to speed. Also, it's a long stretch to the traffic circle at 35th and Hudson, so people feel like they can speed.     Second problem is just the missing segment of sidewalk. The new apartments at 35th and Renton have added about half of the missing sidewalk, but there is still a six house gap.

    "need": "I have two projects that revolve around one street, 42nd Ave S between Genesee Park and S Alaska. Currently the street receives a very high number of cars, many of which are speeding. This poses an issue for (1) number of cars on a residential street using 42nd Ave as a by-pass of Rainier and (2) people trying to cross 42nd Ave S at Genesee Park at the two crossings. Currently there is only a stop sign at 42nd Ave S and Genesee and at Rainier.     Number of Cars per Day    A study was done by SDOT at 42nd Ave S and what appears to be just south of Rainier. The total number of cars was totaled to be approximately 950. This study was done from June 27 through July 5 and is attached. On November 11, 2016 I rented a radar gun from SDOT and recorded traffic on my street between the hours of 8-9 am. I was able to record the speed of 110 cars in that hour long span, and missed approximately 20-30 cars when I could not record the speeds. Extrapolating this data from 110-140 cars in that hour, you get a daily traffic volume of 2,100 to 2,800 cars per day, which far exceeds what should be allowed for a residential street.     Speed of Cars    Due to the hill and the lack of stop signs, cars easily hit 30 mph or higher going up or down. The traffic circle and bump outs at the park do little to slow cars down. We were told by SDOT to use our own cars to park on either side of the street to create narrowing. My wife's car has been hit by cars with no note. During the rental of the radar gun mentioned above, we recorded cars going 5 mph or more above the speed limit to be 54%. Note this was done after the reduction of the speed limit to 20 mph in residential neighborhoods.     The speed of the cars could propose safety issues to pedestrians trying to cross 42nd Ave in Genesee Park. ",
    "idea": "Proposed Projects    I would like to propose a speed/traffic volume study to be performed on 42nd Ave between Snowqualmie and Alaska halfway up the block midway to track the number of cars and max speeds of cars on this street. If the numbers are in line with the data shown below, additional action could be made by SDOT to improve the safety features of the street and to limit the number of cars using it as a bypass.     Proposed safety measures:  Install a three way stop sign at 42nd Ave S and Snoqualmie  Install speed humps through the bends at the park.  Install a barrier to prevent cars from moving on 42nd Ave past Alaska. This will allow cars to turn east onto Alaska to get into the neighborhood, but will prevent cars from using 42nd as the by-pass. In my opinion, this will be one of the only ways to deter cars from using 42nd as a by-pass.  Even if some of the projects cannot be incorporated with this program, I would hope that data showing un-safe driving conditions and car volumes that far exceed acceptable levels for residential streets would be addressed in some manner.

Neighbors have recorded multiple instances of drivers nearly missing pedestrians at this location, either because they ignore the existing legal pedestrian crossing or fail to see the posted 4-way stop.   Drivers traveling north on 50th avenue regularly exceed the posted speed limit, risking injury to pedestrians crossing at this location and collision with vehicles traveling either eastbound or westbound on S. Angeline Street. The blinking red light is also very difficult to see when traveling northbound on 50th avenue because of the declined road grade.    I have personally seen multiple vehicular collisions at this intersection.    SPD officers regularly post on either side of Angeline St. at the intersection because the need only wait a few moments until someone ignores the blinking stop light at this location.    There is a park and playground (Lakewood Park) at the southeast corner of this intersection as well as a community center (Lakewood Seward Park Neighborhood Association) on the northwest corner.

Unfortunately, the sidewalk that for more than 50 years was on the west side of Harvard Ave. E. north of the Lakeview Blvd. intersection was removed by the I-5 construction and was not replaced when I-5 opened in 1962.  This omission magnified the problem that for 300 feet to the north, the sidewalk on the east side of Harvard Ave. E. is far above the street, and very steeply so (precluding access between the street and sidewalk) and thus is reachable at its south end only via stairs near Lakeview Blvd.&mdash;and thus that sidewalk is inaccessible for anyone who has trouble with stairs, such as those with disabilities or who use baby strollers.  Only by re-establishing the sidewalk on the west side of Harvard Avenue E. will there again be a safe pedestrian route.

Allison Street which runs east and west between Eastlake Avenue and Fairview Avenue East is one of the steepest streets that lacks sidewalks in any urban village or urban center  (Eastlake is a residential urban village). Because of the lack of sidewalks, people who are using a wheelchair or a stroller or are on foot (such as senior citizens) have difficulty going safely up or down E. Allison Street. So do bicyclists (who because the hill is too steep to ride up on a bicycle, must walk their bike up E. Allison St.). Drivers also have difficulty walking to and from their parked cars, which are not safely parked because of the lack of curbs.    Although there are sidewalks, curbs, and gutters on the west half of the north side of the block, they are lacking on the rest of the block (about three quarters of the block, including the steepest upper half). There is a need for sidewalks where they are now missing; if possible, curbs and gutters should also be added.    The 1998 Eastlake Neighborhood Plan and the 1999 Approval and Adoption Matrix that the Mayor and City Council adopted in response to the neighborhood plan recognized as a priority the need for sidewalks on this segment of E. Allison Street.  In the 2014 Neighborhood Park and Street Fund process, SDOT approved for funding the missing half of sidewalk on the north side of Allison Street that is east of the half block of existing sidewalk, and preliminary engineering has been done.  However, for some reason SDOT has dropped its efforts to follow through on the project.     The project is even more urgently needed now than it was in 2014 and should be built, and preferably should not have to compete with projects newly proposed in the current 2017 applications cycle.

The meadow area of Carkeek Park Demonstration Gardens is soggy and occasionally experiences standing water.  This condition begins to develop in late October and runs through winter, and into early spring.  The source of this water appears to be the slope immediately to the east of the meadow.  On the slope, a small natural outlet is observed actively leaking water.  In addition to the outlet, the meadow is comprised of poorly-drained soil, which compounds the problem.    An existing trail of approximately 350 feet runs through this area, which is frequented by garden visitors, parents of Tiny Trees preschool children, Parks staff, and garden stewards.  In its present condition, the trail is interrupted by the standing water, slippery mud, and requires improvement.  The following materials are required for trail improvement:   2&rdquo;x4&rdquo; quarry spalls, 5/8&rdquo; minus gravel, &frac14;&rdquo; minus gravel.

The dimensions of the bog garden would be 29 ft in length and 18 ft at the widest point; the deepest (middle) portion of the bog would be 3.5 feet.  In addition, we will improve the existing trail by creating a base of gravel to facilitate drainage, then elevating the trail slightly above the level of the bog garden to keep the trail dry year-round.  As stated above, the trail is approximately 350 feet in length and runs parallel to the bog garden.  ",

My suggestion, to make walking both safer and more pleasant, would be to dedicate more of the road, particularly on side streets to walking space.  Of course, this will impact the current predominant use, parking cars.  Where sidewalks are not feasible could we not, at the very least, change some of the nose-in parking (which takes up nearly all the spare roadside) to parallel parking on one side of the roads?  As it is now, short, development required sidewalks are frequently STOPped by nose-in parked vehicles on the very next property, all perfectly legally.  The decision I usually make is to skip these short intrusions and walk, somewhat nervously, along the street's edge, mostly in on the street side of these nosed in vehicles.    A simple change like this will ruffle feathers of parkers and property owners where parallel parking is newly required, but the safety enhancement and cost of this change in use of city/public property would be a great improvement for the ever increasing pedestrian population!",

First, the sidewalk slopes down sideways toward the ravine, putting pedestrians at risk of sliding or stumbling off the sidewalk and down the embankment into the ravine. Second, there are no barriers between the sidewalk and the cliff edge to catch anyone who's falling, so they'd be severely injured. Third, the sidewalk surface is often slippery due to moss and accumulated leaves, and it's poorly lighted, increasing the likelihood of falling. This is all especially dangerous because the sidewalk is on a main arterial road to get out of our neighborhood to bus stops (often used by walkers, adults pushing strollers, etc.) and also serves an elementary school, so children often use the sidewalk. Finally, there is no sidewalk on the other side of the road, so there's no alternative route other than walking in the road with the traffic.",

In particular, there are two new businesses in particular - a new bar (Toledo) and a smoke shop, as well as a new large apartment complex (Dexter &amp; Hayes) at this intersection - which is resulting in people crossing the street at this intersection, vs the next location which are 2-3 blocks up in either direction along Dexter.    My recommendation is painting an additional cross walk, similar to others on Dexter, to increase crossing safety for patrons of these businesses as well as residents of this street.    Also - it's not clear what neighborhood this is really in - Queen Anne? SLU? It's sort of an inbetween area with a large number of apartments but no specific identity.",

The skatespot design envisions two bowls, two ledges, a hip (two ramps at a 90 degree angle from each other rising to a shared deck), a &ldquo;manny pad&rdquo; (a long low platform allowing skateboarders to make a small jumps where the level changes), and flatground.  The design takes advantage of how the southwest wall drops off down the hillside, proposing that the wall include bouldering (climbing) features.  Toward the southwest there would also be stairs.      The I-5 freeway would shelter the skatespot from precipitation.  Lighting (much of it recessed beneath the stairs and benches to create a striated appearance similar to the freeway I-beams above) would enable nighttime use&mdash;at present not an option for skateboarders unless at an expensive private skatepark.

    "idea": "Implement the elements of the Trail Plan that address ADA accessibility and pedestrian crossing safety. There are also other crosswalks needed in the park that were not within the scope of the  of the trail plan, which only dealt with interior trails and not roads.     For ADA accessibility, the Earthquake Scarp Trail has been graded for ADA standards on the north end, but it needs a barrier or marked turnaround so wheelchairs do not attempt to descend the south end that has stairs. This would be simple and very low cost. In the comprehensive trail plan, it was proposed to make the bald Eagle Trail and the main part of the Sqebeqsed Trail ADA compliant by doing some trail regrading, and putting in a crosswalk from the parking lot by picnic shelter #3 to the trailhead for the Bald Eagle and Lost lake Trails. The crosswalk would benefit the safety of all park users entering the forest at this point and help direct hikers to a  single entrance instead of the two parallel entrances that have developed. Alternatively, ADA access to the Upper Loop Trailhead for the Sqebeqsed Trail could be obtained if appropriate ADA parking were added by the trailhead or at the amphitheater.    Cross walks would also be helpful in other locations:  1)  where the Sqebeqsed Trail crosses the upper loop road from Picnic shelter #2 to the amphitheater  2) on either side of the Japanese Garden in the Entrance circle, connecting the path through the garden to the new torii site. The existing crosswalks at Juneau and Lake Washington Boulevard bypass the entrance to the garden, and most park users have no idea how to access the garden. This would be an excellent location for a culturally appropriate painted crosswalk, perhaps with stylized cherry blossoms.  3) at the bottom of the upper loop road by the parking lot by the Clay Studio. Pedestrians coming the the lower loop path are discharged into the parking lot with no clear direction for continuing, either to the sidewalk on the west side of the lot or to cross the road to the sidewalk on the east side of the upper loop road. A crosswalk and some direction out of the parking lot would improve safety here. Speed bumps have also been suggested for the hill down from the upper loop road.",

The next idea is to improve the lighting and visibility on S. Della Street, right near the parking lot for ACRS. There is no sidewalk on S. Della - it cuts off at a sharp corner and incline that cars rush through and can't anticipate pedestrians. Since there is no paved sidewalk, it gets muddy and becomes dangerous in rainy weather. One idea is to put mirrors to view ongoing street traffic like cars and bicycles to increase pedestrian safety in that area. Also more lighting on S.

The McGilvra Elementary School in Madison Park is isolated geographically from most of the residential neighborhoods that it serves by steep hills, a golf course and busy arterial streets that act as barriers. Presently there are few pedestrian or bicycle friendly approaches to the school that would lead parents to choose walking and biking to school over driving, and none that cross the arterial community divide of Lake Washington Blvd. However, there is one route that has the potential to become a safe bicycling and walking route to school for all students who live west of Lake Washington Blvd.  ",
    "idea": "Implement the Hillside Drive Greenway that is in the approved 2014 City of Seattle Bicycle Master Plan as part of the citywide backbone of the all&shy;-ages&shy;-and&shy;-abilities bicycle network. This route was identified by McGilvra PTA parents, scouts of Madison Park Greenways, the leadership of the Madison Park Community Council and The Bush School AMP program students.  The only candidate greenway linking Madison Park with points to the South and to the West and North is via the corridor that extends from 39th Ave E, to Hillside Dr E, to the edge of the McGilvra &ldquo;walk zone&rdquo; at Lake Washington Blvd East. This prospective greenway is the Hillside Drive Greenway. Topography leaves no other viable greenway candidates as below this corridor is a busy arterial, McGilvra Blvd, and above is a steep hill which renders passage by bicycle unrealistic for most riders.   This proposed project integrates in a fundamental way with several approved SDOT projects. In particular, a 2015 NPSF awarded project (2015&shy;058) is currently studying the intersection with Lake Washington Blvd at one end of the proposed greenway. This intersection would allow a seamless connection with the proposed E Harrison Greenway between 29th Ave E and 39th Ave E. In addition a 2014 NPSF awarded project (2014&shy;064)  for the design intersection revision for Madison St and McGilvra Blvd E is located near the other end of the proposed greenway.",

    "project_title": "Sidewalk on Lakeview Blvd between E. Blaine and E. Howe streeets. ",
    "need": "Lakeview Blvd. is a principal arterial that is just east of Interstate 5.  There are sidewalks on both sides of its full length with the sole exception of one block (340 feet) on the east side of Lakeview Blvd. between East Blaine Street and East Howe Street.  Blaine and Howe streets at this point are steep and exist only as heavily used public staircases (among the longest in Seattle) that connect the top of Capitol Hill (10th Avenue East) to the Lake Union area.      Between the E. Blaine and E. Howe Street stairs, a sidewalk is missing on the east side of Lakeview Blvd.  Its absence is a risk and barrier for many pedestrians who use this area for commuting, exercise, sight-seeing, or to reach homes, businesses, and nearby parks as well as to such areas as Melrose, South Lake Union, downtown, and the University District.  In all such cases, Lakeview Blvd. is a crucial link, and requires the sidewalk.      The sidewalk is especially needed by the thousands each week who use the E. Blaine and E. Howe Street public staircases that extend east from Lakeview Blvd. up Capitol Hill to 10th Avenue East, and west to Lake Union via the Park Department&rsquo;s Colonnade public staircase under I-5 that follows the Blaine St. alignment.  Many people use the Blaine and Howe Street staircases not just for travel but as an exercise circuit. The lack of a sidewalk between the staircases is a dangerous barrier to this use and an attractive nuisance.    To traverse north-south this block of missing sidewalk, pedestrians currently face two equally perilous alternatives:  either walk in the roadway on the east side of Lakeview Blvd., or make two crossings of Lakeview Blvd. to and from the sidewalk on its west side.  In both cases, they are mixing with fast-moving traffic, including from the nearby I-5 northbound off-ramp.  It&rsquo;s not only very inconvenient, but a tragedy waiting to happen.    SDOT has studied installing 340 feet of 6-foot wide sidewalk, concrete curb and gutter (planting strips would be omitted in order to minimize costs).  With or without the proposed sidewalk, a retaining wall may be needed, as the hillside continues to slump across the curb into the roadway, forcing pedestrians and bicyclists towards the center of the street.       To minimize the need for a retaining wall, the curb could be moved another six feet into the roadway in order to narrow Lakeview Blvd. and create a new sidewalk that would not be as close to the hillside.  However, moving the curb and sidewalk into the current roadway could expose pedestrians to motor vehicles jumping the curb, and the sidewalk would still be subject to landslides that are best dealt with by a retaining wall.     A sidewalk without a retaining wall is likely not sustainable either for landslide safety or for what is best for pedestrian safety and for preserving public parking along Lakeview Blvd.  Pedestrian funds should not bear the full cost of the retaining wall, as SDOT owes it to motorists to prevent a landslide into Lakeview Blvd.   ",

In addition to that, pedestrians cross in front of that ramp without looking to see if there are any bikes coming down in their direction. I believe some simple signage alerting people traveling in all directions at this walkway intersection would help keep commuters, students, and everyone safe.",

On the other side of things, pedestrians who are walking from the station to the crosswalk at Montlake and Pacific should see some kind of sign, such as &quot;WATCH FOR BICYCLES&quot; or &quot;BICYCLES CROSSING&quot; so they know that they need to check to make sure it's safe to cross the path.",

    "need": "When in 2005 the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department opened the I-5 Colonnade Open Space, it did not provide an ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliant entry from Franklin Avenue E. on the park's central west side near E. Blaine Street.   The ADA-accessible switchback pathway that is accessible from Colonnade&rsquo;s NW and NE entries effectively ends to the southwest at a dead end for wheelchair users.  Although this pathway continues southwest to the Blaine St. entry, its short continuation to the southwest is far too steep for anyone with a disability, and is uncomfortably steep for most pedestrians and bicyclists.       Also lacking in ADA accessibility, and uncomfortably steep for most pedestrians and bicyclists is the east-west maintenance road that provides a pathway to and from Colonnade&rsquo;s E. Blaine St. entry on Colonnade&rsquo;s west side.  This route is the only east or west access to Colonnade's granite gathering area and to the north end of the off-leash area.      This lack of disability access at a major entrance to a significant City park was identified as a priority for correction by the 2016 schematic long-range plan that was produced with Neighborhood Matching Funds in coordination with City agencies and the Washington State Department of Transportation.  This accessibility problem first came to the attention of the planning and design process as a result of concern expressed by a dog owner who is disabled and can&rsquo;t reach the north end of the off-leash area.    To solve the ADA-accessibility gap just described (and without interfering with the WSDOT/Parks Dept. maintenance road), the 2016 schematic long-range plan envisions an ADA-accessible pathway whose gradual slope is achieved by extending into the area of redwood trees that is just west of the off-leash area, being slightly raised above the ground so as not to damage their roots.  All pedestrians would benefit from the easier slope and from the beauty amidst the redwoods, without getting wet feet.  Conceptual designs for the proposed pathway are provided at http://eastlakeseattle.org/?page=colonnade.    ",

For the past seven years we have functioned as an all-volunteer nonprofit organization, offering weekly practices and games and connecting hundreds of youth transitioning off of the street to a supportive community of caring adults. At the same time that we introduce youth to the skills to succeed on the field, we also impart skills that help them succeed off the field and find greater success and peace in their lives. Thus far, we have relied on the generosity of University Presbyterian Church for an indoor space to hold our weekly practices. During the summer months, we practice on the tennis courts at University Playground. In 2017, we have begun discussions with the Seattle Sounders and our parent organization, Street Soccer USA, about creating a permanent field to be managed by our organization somewhere within the city. We thought this process could be a perfect opportunity to explore the idea further with city officials.     Not only would this field activate the park year round, it could prove an important project to help address our city's worsening homelessness crisis. ",

Either move the runnel to the other side of the stairs or move the handrail to the other side of the stairs so that people can use the runnel to push bikes up and down the stairs.  ",

Also, because the sidewalk is narrow and the traffic busy, the air pollution is unpleasant. If well chosen trees could be added that would be helpful. The openings between N 49th and 2nd Ave NW along that same stretch are too wide for pedestrians to cross safely. I've also seen a number of middle schoolers try to cross Market in that stretch. There are no traffic lights and so it is very unsafe. Additionally the view is lovely if you could stop and enjoy it. Currently, it's just too busy a road and the air is not very good, not to mention the space is tight.",
